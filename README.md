# 1timeshare
Sometimes we need to share our credentials with our dear one's,
We share it over messengers such as facebook, 
Whatss app. 
And those credentials stays there forever. 
I have attempted a credential share channel. 
Where credentials will be temporarily stored in encrypted form. 
And a link will be provided to you. You can share that link with intended recipient.
Once that link is accessed, credentials will be returned. 
And the link will expired, immediately.
